     <h4> My name is Carly Rogers , I am 16 years old.Im raised in a family of shopaholics so you know what that means ...I am a girl who loves having fun and shopping but have no job lol , crazy right?
      I don't have a job but love to spend money and most of time it's not my money but my parents know the stuff I like and that its expensive so they know what they got into.
     I love brands and designers that's well known , I don't follow a trend because I AM THE TREND. Im raised in a family where 9/10 we get whatever we ask for most of the time but im not a spoiled brat.
